# Taco Cat, again...

![Home page](https://github.com/mackenzieweaver/InitialCoreMVC/blob/main/InitialCoreMVC/tacocatmvc.png)

### Why did I make Taco Cat, again...?

Because this time it's built with ASP.NET Core MVC.

### The live site

The site is not live because it has not been hosted and/or deployed anywhere.

### Download
